## Getting Started

Beed Identification is a feature in this app that you can use to know the breed of your dog. This identification process is performed based on an image of your dog you upload or take an image with your phone’s camera. For now, we can identify 130 dog breeds with significant accuracy. It is obvious that sometimes the breed might not be correctly identified as this is completely based on the visual feature of your dog. To utilize the full potential of our identification algorithm we recommend you to take the picture of your dog in certain set of criteria.  
1. Please take the snap of the dog in sufficient lighting.    
2. Please take the full body image of the dog.       
3. Please make sure the head is clearly visible.                                       
4. You can try multiple times with different images to cross-check with the result. 

This feature of our app allows you to search for breeds based on your preferred criteria. For now, you can find the breeds based on different sets of parameters. These parameters include Ideal Height, Ideal Weight ranges including Temperaments and Utilization. You can apply all the search queries at a time or leave any of them empty. The more parameters you set the more rigorous the search becomes. If this feature doesn’t help to find your desired dog then you can see the full list of the dogs and learn about each of them in the Full List fragment of the app.
